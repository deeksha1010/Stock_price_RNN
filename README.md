# 📈 Stock Price Prediction for Meta (2012-2023)

This project uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to predict Meta's stock price from 2012 to 2023! By applying both **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) and **GRU** (Gated Recurrent Units), we take a sequence of 30 days' worth of data to predict the price of the 31st day. 

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for building the RNN models
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
- **LSTM** and **GRU** layers for sequential data modeling
The model is trained on the stock prices to predict the next day's price using the past 30 days as input.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Input**: A sequence of 30 days' stock prices.
- **Output**: Predicted price for the 31st day.
- **Comparison**: Compare the actual stock price with the predicted one.

## 📈 Results

The models provide predictions based on historical trends, showing their ability to estimate future stock prices! Feel free to tweak parameters and experiment!
